# patentology-api 

## Overview

This library powers Patentology.org. The objective is to create an unofficial API for Canadian Intellectual Property Office's (CIPO) patent database. I hope this will facilitate the work of other developers and researchers.

This **project is still under development**. While I am actively working on making it more stable, by identifying and fixing bugs, and adding additional features, it is **not recommended** to currently use this library for any sensitive work.

## Specification

Please refer to the interactive specification at [patentology.org](http://www.patentology.org/docs/index.html#/default) for now. It was created using the open source [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) framework. A more comprehensive version will soon be added to this page.
