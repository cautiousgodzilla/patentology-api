# patentology-api 

## Overview

This library powers Patentology.org. The objective is to create an unofficial API for Canadian Intellectual Property Office's (CIPO) patent database. I hope this will facilitate the work of other developers and researchers.

**Disclaimer:** This API has no official status and there is no guarantee of accuracy or completeness.

## Documentation

Please refer to the interactive documentation at [patentology.org](http://www.patentology.org/docs/) for now. It was created using the open source [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) framework. A more comprehensive version will be added to this page at a later time.

## API Endpoints

### /search

Use this endpoint to search for one or more patents using the specified search criteria.
