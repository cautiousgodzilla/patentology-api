Welcome to Patentology API's documentation!
===========================================

Patentology API is an unofficial RESTful API for the Canadian patent database maintained by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO).

We have code examples in Python, but you can use any language you like. All API responses are in JSON format with UTF-8 character encoding.

Each time a request is made to the Patentology API, another request is made from our end to the CIPO database. Therefore, please ensure that you read and follow CIPOâ€™s `Conditions of Use <http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/disclaimer.html>`_.
